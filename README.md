# foveated-metamers

Create metamers using models of the ventral stream and run experiments to validate them

This project starts with a replication of Freeman and Simoncelli,
2011, out to higher eccentricities, and will extend it by looking at
spatial frequency information as well.

# Requirements

Need to make sure you have ffmpeg on your path when creating the
metamers, so make sure it's installed.

When running on NYU's prince cluster, can use `module load
ffmpeg/intel/3.2.2` or, if `module` isn't working (like when using the
`fish` shell), just add it to your path manually (e.g., on fish: `set
-x PATH /share/apps/ffmpeg/3.2.2/intel/bin $PATH`)
