Variable	Variable name	Measurement unit / data type	Allowed values	Definition	Description
image_name	Name of the reference image	str	azulejos_full_size-2048,3528; market_full_size-2048,3528; tiles_full_size-2048,3528; flower_full_size-2048,3528	image_name is the name of the reference, which involves taking the file name from target_image and removing the extension.	Technically, many more values are possible than those given in Allowed values, but these are the four from of our experiment.
model	Model name	str	RGC_norm_gaussian, V1_norm_s6_gaussian	The model name is the string which identifies which type of model to build.	See the docstring of create_metamers.main() for more details on how this string is structured, but the string identifies the visual area we're modeling, the window type, the number of scales to include (V1 only) and whether to normalize or not. There are many more possible variants than the two given in Allowed values, but those are the only two used in this experiment. This should be the same for every trial in a given experiment.
trial_type	Trial type	str	'metamer_vs_metamer' or 'metamer_vs_reference'	Trial type tells us whether the two images compared on this trial were both metamers or whether one was a metamer.	In most metamerism experiments, metamers are compared against each other. We also compare metamers against the reference image, and would like to be able to tell whether there's a difference in the resulting psychometric curves. column specifies which type of trial this was.
scaling	Pooling window scaling value	float	Any positive finite float (no NaN or infinity)	scaling gives the slope of the linear relationship between pooling window full-width half-maximum and eccentricity	This is the model parameter that we're testing in our experiment, and we test 9 values for each model. It's inspired by the established linear relationship between neural receptive fields and eccentricity. As successive areas in the ventral stream have larger and larger scaling values, so too do the values we test: RGC has the smallest set of values, then V1, and then V2, but each successive model will have at least one scaling value that overlaps, for ease of comparison.
subject_name	Subject name	str	'sub-%02d' % i, where i runs from 1 to 30, inclusive	subject_name is the name of the subject for this experimental session.	Each subject sees every trial once per session. Each (subject, session) pair has a different random seed used to generate the presentation index.
session_number	Session number	int	0, 1, or 2	session_number is the number of this experimental session	Each subject has 3 sessions per model, in which they see all trials once; the sessions only differ in their presentation order.
n_trials	Number of trials	int	Any positive finite int (no NaN or infinity)	n_trials is the number of trials in this condition.	Assuming everything has been run to completion, then we should have the same number of trials for all models, subjects, and sessions, but this number is here in case that didn't happen (e.g., you're looking at the data before data collection has finished). Additionally, there will not be the same number of metamer_vs_metamer and metamer_vs_reference trials (there will be more metamer_vs_metamer trials), and so this is to enable you to correctly combine them if you want to average across the two conditions.
proportion_correct	Proportion correct	float	Between 0 and 1 (inclusive)	proportion_correct is the percentage of trials in this condition where the subject answered correctly.
