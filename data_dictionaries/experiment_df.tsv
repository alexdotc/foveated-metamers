Variable	Variable name	Measurement unit / data type	Allowed values	Definition	Description
image_name	Name of the reference image	str	azulejos_full_size-2048,3528; market_full_size-2048,3528; tiles_full_size-2048,3528; flower_full_size-2048,3528	image_name is the name of the reference, which involves taking the file name from base_signal and removing the extension.	Technically, many more values are possible than those given in Allowed values, but these are the four from of our experiment.
image_1	Seed of first image presented	int or str	0, 1, 2, or 'reference'	image_1 is the random seed used for the generation of the first image presented in this trial, or 'reference', which signifies that this was the reference image (and thus had no random seed associated with it).
image_2	Seed of second image presented	int or str	0, 1, 2, or 'reference'	image_1 is the random seed used for the generation of the second image presented in this trial, or 'reference', which signifies that this was the reference image (and thus had no random seed associated with it).
image_X	Seed of third image presented	int or str	0, 1, 2, or 'reference'	image_1 is the random seed used for the generation of the third image presented in this trial, or 'reference', which signifies that this was the reference image (and thus had no random seed associated with it).
trial_number	Number of this trial	int	Any non-negative finite integer (no NaN or infinity)	trial_number is the index of this trial.	Since this is python, the first trial has trial_number 0.
correct_response	Correct response for this trial	int	1 or 2	correct_response is the number the subject was supposed to press in order to have this trial deemed a 'hit'.	The subject's task is to say whether image X matched image 1 or image 2, and press the corresponding key; this number is the key they were supposed to press, so it gives whether image X was a repeat of the first or second image.
model	Model name	str	RGC_norm_gaussian, V1_norm_s6_gaussian	The model name is the string which identifies which type of model to build.	See the docstring of create_metamers.main() for more details on how this string is structured, but the string identifies the visual area we're modeling, the window type, the number of scales to include (V1 only) and whether to normalize or not. There are many more possible variants than the two given in Allowed values, but those are the only two used in this experiment. This should be the same for every trial in a given experiment.
trial_type	Trial type	str	'metamer_vs_metamer' or 'metamer_vs_reference'	Trial type tells us whether the two images compared on this trial were both metamers or whether one was a metamer.	In most metamerism experiments, metamers are compared against each other. We also compare metamers against the reference image, and would like to be able to tell whether there's a difference in the resulting psychometric curves. column specifies which type of trial this was.
scaling	Pooling window scaling value	float	Any positive finite float (no NaN or infinity)	scaling gives the slope of the linear relationship between pooling window full-width half-maximum and eccentricity	This is the model parameter that we're testing in our experiment, and we test 9 values for each model. It's inspired by the established linear relationship between neural receptive fields and eccentricity. As successive areas in the ventral stream have larger and larger scaling values, so too do the values we test: RGC has the smallest set of values, then V1, and then V2, but each successive model will have at least one scaling value that overlaps, for ease of comparison.
subject_response	Subject response for this trial	int	1 or 2	subject_response is the number the subject pressed on this trial.
hit_or_miss	Trial outcome	str	'hit' or 'miss'	hit_or_miss gives whether the trial's outcome was a hit or miss.	A trial is a 'hit' when the subject is correct (so when subject_response and correct_response agree) and a 'miss' when the subject is incorrect (so when subject_response and correct_response disagree)
subject_name	Subject name	str	'sub-%02d' % i, where i runs from 1 to 30, inclusive	subject_name is the name of the subject for this experimental session.	Each subject sees every trial once per session. Each (subject, session) pair has a different random seed used to generate the presentation index.
session_number	Session number	int	0, 1, or 2	session_number is the number of this experimental session	Each subject has 3 sessions per model, in which they see all trials once; the sessions only differ in their presentation order.
